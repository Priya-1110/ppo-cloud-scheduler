"""
DQN Inference Socket Server
---------------------------
Purpose:
    Hosts a simple TCP socket server that loads a pretrained DQN model 
    (Stable-Baselines3) and provides inference for a single state request at a time.

Protocol:
    Client -> Server:
        JSON string containing key "state", where "state" is a direct JSON list of 
        floats (no double-encoding like in PPO). 
        Example:
            {"state": [0.75, 0.45, 0.20, 1.0, 0.35]}

    Server -> Client:
        JSON string containing key "action", where "action" is the integer index 
        of the chosen cloud.
        Example:
            {"action": 1}

Key Notes:
    - The input state must be a list with the same dimensionality used during DQN training.
      Here, it is reshaped to (1, -1) for compatibility with SB3 predict().
    - This server is synchronous and handles one connection at a time.
      For concurrent handling, wrap the client connection in threads or async I/O.
    - The learning rate schedule is overridden on load with a fixed lambda to 
      avoid SB3 incompatibility warnings.
    - Server stops gracefully with a KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C).
